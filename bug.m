In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object ownership and memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting).  Consider a scenario where a method returns an object, and the caller doesn't retain it, assuming it's automatically managed. However, if the object's lifecycle is tied to a different scope (e.g., a temporary variable within the method), it might be deallocated prematurely. This results in dangling pointers or unexpected crashes when attempting to access that object later.
